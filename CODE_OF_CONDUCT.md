# Code of Conduct

The Hylo community works to foster a positive environment for individuals from all walks of life and commits to treating each and everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual identity and orientation, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, socio-economic status, disability or level of experience.

To that end, this code of conduct gives clarity over what is expected of the members of our community.
This document applies to everyone engaging with the spaces managed by the Hylo project, and to anyone speaking as a member of the Hylo community in any space, regardless of the method of communication.

## Guidelines

We expect the following from every member of our community.
- **Be welcoming.** Strive to welcome and supports each and every one. Keep in mind that other people may have different academic or professional backgrounds, native languages, or cultural experiences.
- **Be patient.** Interact with others in a way that encourages participation, regardless of the level of experience of the people involved. Keep your feedback constructive and acknowledge that we are all on an endless learning journey.
- **Be considerate.** Keep in mind that the ideas we put forward, the work we do, and the decision we make will have an impact on others. As such, we should remember to take others' perspectives into account.
- **Be kind.** Reasonable people may disagree but never be disrespectful. Insults, harassment, humiliation, provocation, intimidation, or any other form of psychological abuse shall not be tolerated.
- **Choose your words carefully and be charitable.** Written text poorly communicates tone, emotion, or body language. Spend some time considering how your words may be understood and interpret others charitably.

This list only lays down some ground rules and is by no means exhaustive.

Here are examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

In contrast, here are examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Using discriminatory language, even in the context of a joke
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material
- Publishing or threatening to publish others' private information without their explicit permission.
- Insulting or putting down others
- Persisting in some behavior after having been asked to stop

## Enforcement

At present, instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [coc@hylo-lang.org](mailto:coc@hylo-lang.org).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
