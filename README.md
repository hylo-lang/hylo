# Hylo (formerly Val)


[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hylo-lang/hylo/graph/badge.svg?token=YF1Q8W88VN)](https://codecov.io/gh/hylo-lang/hylo)

Hylo is a programming language that leverages [mutable value semantics](Docs/ImplementationStrategiesForMutableValueSemantics.pdf) and [generic programming](https://fm2gp.com) for high-level systems programming.

This repository contains the sources of the reference implementation of Hylo.
Please visit our **[website](https://hylo-lang.org)** to get more information about the language itself.

## Development/Use Requirements

This project is written in [Swift](https://swift.org) and distributed in the form of a package, built with either [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) or CMake.
You will need Swift 6.1 or higher to build the compiler from sources.
**This repository contains
[submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)**,
so after cloning, issue `git submodule update --init` to populate
them.

**Windows users:** this repository contains symbolic links, so you'll
need to [enable support](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59761201/125349)
for them before checking it out.

### LLVM

This package requires LLVM 20. Major versions of LLVM are not
interchangeable or backward-compatible.

If you are using this package for development, we strongly recommend
the use of an LLVM with assertions enabled; otherwise it's too
easy to violate LLVM's preconditions without knowing it. 
You can download such a prebuilt LLVM package from Hylo's 
[LLVM builds](https://github.com/hylo-lang/llvm-build).
If you are using development containers, this is already installed preinstalled on the system. Run `llvm-config --prefix` to see where.

On **Windows**, make sure to set the environment variable `VSINSTALLDIR` to something like
`C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community`, without `/` at the end. This is needed for LLVM to locate the DIA SDK.

## Building with CMake and Ninja

1. **Configure**: choose a *build-directory* and a CMake *build type*
   (usually `Debug` or `Release`) and then, where `<LLVM>` is the path
   to the root directory of your LLVM installation,

	```
	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build-type> -D LLVM_DIR=<LLVM>/lib/cmake/llvm -DBUILD_TESTING=1 -G Ninja -S . -B .build
   ```
 
   If you don't want to run tests, remove `-DBUILD_TESTING=1`.
    
   **MacOS-specific flags**
    - If you are not using the default Swift toolchain, [you may need `-D CMAKE_Swift_COMPILER=swiftc`](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25750) to prevent CMake from using Xcode's default `swift`.
    - Add `-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)`

2. **Build**: 

   ```
   cmake --build <build-directory>
   ```

3. **Test** (requires `-DBUILD_TESTING=1` in step 1):

   ```
   ctest --parallel --test-dir <build-directory>
   ```

## Building with CMake and Xcode

You will need CMake 3.30 or newer.

1. **Generate Xcode project**: choose a *build-directory* and then,
   where `<LLVM>` is the path to the root directory of your LLVM
   installation,

    ```
    cmake -D LLVM_DIR=<LLVM>/lib/cmake/llvm \
      -G Xcode -S . -B <build-directory>
    ```

    If you want to run tests, add `-DBUILD_TESTING=1`.

2. **Profit**: open the `.xcodeproj` file in the *build-directory* and
   use Xcode's UI to build and test.

## Building with Swift Package Manager

You can skip the following steps if you are using development containers.

1. Install [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config).
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install pkg-config`
  - Windows: `choco install pkgconfiglite` ([Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pkgconfiglite)) or [install it manually](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgconfiglite/)
  - MacOS: `sudo port install pkgconfig` ([Mac Ports](https://ports.macports.org/port/pkgconfig/))
installed, and `<YOUR LLVM>/pkgconfig` added to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
2. Add your LLVM installation's `pkgconfig` subfolder to `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`.

Now you should be able to build and test:
```bash
swift build -c release
swift test -c release
```

That command will create an executable named `hc` in `.build/release`.
That's Hylo's compiler!

To test your compiler,

```bash
swift test -c release --parallel
```

#### Notes to macOS users:

1. Add `platforms: [.macOS("xxx")]` to `Package.swift` where `xxx` is
   your macOS version to address the warning complaining that an
   "object file was built for newer macOS version than being linked".

### Building a Hylo Devcontainer with VSCode

While Hylo supports Linux natively, it also provides a [Devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) specification to develop for Linux on other platforms through a Docker container. Our [Linux CI](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml) uses this specification; this makes it possible to run Linux CI locally on other operating systems like macOS. While this specification should work for any IDE that supports devcontainers, keep in mind this team only uses VSCode.

When opening the Hylo project in VSCode for the first time, you should be prompted to install the extension `recommendations` in `.vscode/extensions.json`. If you are not prompted, manually install the extensions by searching for the extension identifiers in the Extensions Marketplace.

Then, build the Devcontainer with the VSCode command: `> Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

Finally, open a new integrated terminal in VSCode and confirm that the shell user is `vscode`. You can run `whoami` to check this.

That integrated terminal is connected to the Devcontainer, as if by ssh.  
You can now follow the instructions for Building and testing [with CMake and Ninja](#building_with_ cmake_and_ninja) or [with Swift Package Manager](#building_with_swift_package_manager).
All prerequisites, including the `llvm.pc` file in the default `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, are preinstalled.

The Hylo repository files are mounted into the container, so any changes made locally (in VSCode or in other editors) will be automatically propagated into the Devcontainer. However, if you need to modify any of the files in the `.devcontainer` directory, you will need to rebuild the container with `> Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

### Submitting issues

For submitting issue reports you need to manually update the Hylo version.
Without this step, ``hc --version`` returns ``unknown``.

```bash
./Tools/set-hc-version.sh
```

## Implementation status

This project is under active development; expect things to break and APIs to change.

The compiler pipeline is organized as below.
You can select how deep the compiler should go through the pipeline with the following options:
- `--emit raw-ast`: Only parse the input files and output an untyped AST as a JSON file.
- `--typecheck`: Run the type checker on the input.
- `--emit raw-ir`: Lower the typed AST into Hylo IR and output the result in a file.
- `--emit ir`: Run mandatory IR passes and output the result in a file.
- `--emit llvm`: Transpile the program to LLVM and output LLVM IR.
- `--emit intel-asm`: Output Intel assembly for all user module(s).
- `--emit binary` (default): Produce an executable.

For example, `hc --emit raw-ast -o main.json main.hylo` will parse `main.hylo`, write the untyped AST in `main.json`, and exit the pipeline.

A more detailed description of the current implementation status is available on our [roadmap page](https://www.hylo-lang.org/pages/implementation-status.html).
