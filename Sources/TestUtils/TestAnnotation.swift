/// A test annotation in a source file.
///
/// Test annotations are parsed from comments in the source. They are composed of a command with,
/// optionally, an argument and/or line offset.
///
///     //! <offset> <command> <argument>
///
/// The character sequence `//!` is recognized as an annotation line opener, unless it is already
/// part of a comment. The characters between `//!` and the next new line form an annotation body.
/// For example:
///
///     //! @+1 line-annotation a b c
///     foo()
///
/// The line offset of the annotation is `+1`, its command is `line-annotation` and its argument is
/// the string "`a b c`" (without quotes).
///
/// The character sequence `/*!` is recognized as an annotation block opener, unless it is already
/// part of a comment. The block terminates immediately after a matching multiline comment closing
/// delimiter (i.e., `*/`). The sequence of characters that starts immediately after an annotation
/// block opener and the corresponding comment closing delimiter form an annotation body.
///
/// An annotation body corresponds to a single annotation. When present, the line offset is parsed
/// as a natural number prefixed by either `@+` or `@-`. The next sequence of non-whitespace
/// characters is parsed as the command. Preceding whitespaces are ignored; following whitespaces
/// are ignored only if they are on the same line as the command. The remainder of the annotation
/// body is parsed as the argument.
///
/// If the argument starts on a different line than the command, the spaces before the first
/// non-space first non-space character of the argument defines the indentation pattern of the
/// argument and are not part of its value. Each line of an argument must be prefixed by the its
/// indentation pattern.
///
///     /*! cpp
///     struct Foo {
///       int bar;
///     };
///     */
///
/// The command of the annotation is `cpp` and the argument is a C++ struct declaration with no
/// indentation on the first and last line, and two spaces before the field declaration..
