/// Implementation notes
/// ====================
///
/// This transformation pass implements the following algorithm:
///
/// 1. Gather all reifiable access instructions in the function in a set `W`.
/// 2. While an instruction `i` can be popped from `W`:
///   a. Initialize a set `R` with the weakest capability offered by `i`.
///   b. Gather the requested capabilities on `i` from all its uses into `R`.
///   c. If `R` is the singleton `{k}`, reify `i` as an access providing just `k`. Otherwise,
///      insert `i` back into `W`.
///   d. Go back to step 2.
///
/// The algorithm converges because a reifiable `i` is put back into `W` if and only if all its
/// uses are other reifiable accesses. Since a definition cannot use itself, dependencies between
/// reifiable accesses form a forest whose leaves do not have reifiable user. Iterating over the
/// elements in `W` eliminates those leaves, forming a smaller forest until `W` is empty.
///
/// Step 2b is implemented by `Module.forEachClient(of:)` and `Module.requests(_:)`. The former
/// iterates over all the uses of an instruction, traversing instructions that compute derived
/// addresses (.e.g., `subfield_view`). The latter returns the set of requested capabilities for
/// each user. As well-formed accesses to memory must be done via `access`, there's a fairly small
/// number of instructions to consider.
///
/// Note that `move` are assumed to request `inout` only as assignment should be preferred over
/// initialization. This assumption is sound because if the reifiable access only provides `set`,
/// then `move` will be rewritten as initialization during the DI pass.
