#  C++ transpilation

## Implementation notes

The transpiler will take Val AST and convert into a CXX AST corresponding to C++ code.
The C++ code is then generated by walking the CXX AST producing the textual representation for the Val module.

### Module

A Val module is transpiled as a C++ compilation unit, composed of one header and one source file.
All transpiled symbols are defined in the module namespace.
The header of a transpiled unit exposes the public symbols of the module through a C++ API.
